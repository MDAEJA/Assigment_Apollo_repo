## Interactive README for Your Website Project

Welcome to the interactive README for your website project! In this README, we'll explore the structure of your website by discussing the different sections 
and tags used in your HTML file (`index.html`) and the corresponding styling in your CSS file (`styles.css`). We'll also include screenshots to visually guide
you through your website.
